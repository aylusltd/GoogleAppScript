# Google App Script Scriptlets#
These scripts are tools that I have used, or use everyday. Some of them are modified from their native form, or removed from the files they were originally written in so any testing and commentary is hugely appreciated. 

As I get time I'll put new scriptlets and tools in, but this is not a high priority.

##Address2Link##
Address to link automagically replaces addresses with clickable links to Google Maps in selected sells in selected sheets. It fires onEdit, and checks to make sure the editted cell is on a whitelist in the global variables.

##Num2Str##
Num2Str converts a number to a string of characters, (i.e. 1 = "A", 27="AA", 53="BA") to allow you to figure out column titles in A1 notation or name variables.

It's a pretty simple function, but definitely helps to have.
